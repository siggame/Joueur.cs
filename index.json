    "keywords": "C# Joueur Client This is the client for the Cadre AI framework. It can play multiple different games, though you will probably only be interested in one at a time. In general, try to stay out of the Joueur/ folder, it does most of the heavy lifting to play on our game servers. Your AI, and the game objects it manipulates are all in Games/GAME_NAME/ , with your very own AI living in Games/GAME_NAME/ai.cs for you to make smarter. How to Run This client has been tested and confirmed to work on the Missouri S&T Windows machines loaded with Visual Studio 2013/2015, but it can work on your own Windows/Linux/Mac machines if you desire. It will not work on the campus rc##xcs213 Linux machines however, as their version of Mono is out of date. Windows Visual Studio Most C# developers are comfortable with Microsoft's Visual Studio, so we make sure this works easily in VS. Simply installing Visual Studio 2015 or newer as well as the .NET Desktop Development workload installed. With those installed, Just open up the sln file in this repo and build + run it. Note : You'll need to add command line args in visual studio to the project's solution to tell the game server what game you want to play. The args should be: GAME_NAME -s game.siggame.io -r MyOwnGameSession Visual Studio Code / Command Line usage If you instead opt to develop in Visual Studio Code, Atom, or any other development enviroment that requires command line usage, Microsoft's dotnet core has you covered. Simply install it from Microsoft's website and sure the dotnet command works from your favorite terminal, then run: To Build: dotnet restore dotnet build -o build To Run: ./build/joueur-cs GAME_NAME -s game.siggame.io Linux Install dotnet 2.0 ( make sure you install the prerequisites too ) After those dependencies install, to run the client: make ./testRun MyOwnGameSession Other Notes Try not to modify the .csproj file. It is possible that on your Missouri S&T S-Drive this client will not run properly. This is not a fault with the client, but rather the school's S-Drive implementation changing some file permissions during run time. We cannot control this. Instead, we recommend cloning your repo outside the S-Drive and use an SCP program like WinSCP to edit the files in Windows using whatever IDE you want if you want to code in Windows, but compile in Linux. The only file you should ever modify to create your AI is the AI.cs file. All the other files are needed for the game to work. In addition, you should never be creating your own instances of the Game's classes, nor should you ever try to modify their variables. Instead, treat the Game and its members as a read only structure that represents the game state on the game server. You interact with it by calling the game functions."
